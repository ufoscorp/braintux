# BrainTux

Amazing automation for your life.

## Modules

Braintux is made by modules. **Everything are modules**. Some of them serve to make the communication between Braintux and you, we call them by **views**.

### View Modules

    * You can see all the Braintux output in your terminal.
* Whatsapp
    * You can control Braintux from your smartphone using WhatsApp, download files, with voice recognition and more.
